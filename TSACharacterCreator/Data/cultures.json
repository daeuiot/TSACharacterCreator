[{"key":"CULEK","name":"Earth Kingdom","description":"This vast realm spans an entire continent as well as several subsidiary islands;it is the largest and most populated sovereignty in the world and encompasses much of the easternhemisphere. Like the Fire Nation, the Earth Kingdom is ruled by a central monarchy. The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong and adhere to a philosophy of peaceful coexistence and cooperation with the other nations of the world. Earthbenders use their abilities for defense and industry and fiercely defended their cities against Fire Nation attacks during the Hundred Year War. It also has a large economy based on agriculture and limited industry, though it is not as economically powerful as the Fire Nation, which benefits from advanced technology.\n\nThe Earth Kingdom is characterized by significant ethnic and cultural diversity, a consequence of the country\u0027s vast territorial expanse. Thus, it suffers from high levels of local autonomy and ethnic conflict, both of which began accelerating as the central government grew weak. Despite this division, the people\u0027s recognition of the Earth Kingdom as a single political entity is largely strengthened through the communal belief in a shared history and identity."},{"key":"CULFN","name":"Fire Nation","description":"Despite their ultimate loss after the Hundred Year War, Fire Nation culture has changed very little in 70 years. Still proud, Fire Nation citizens hold the honor of others in the highest regard. The nation’s capital, known simply as “The Capital” ismonument to the storied legacy of the Fire Nation and the nobility of its monarchy. The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy and drive to achieve what they want. Fire Nation society places a great emphasis on respect and honor, especially toward the nobility and elders; the concept of the famed Agni Kai stems from these beliefs.\n\nThe Fire Nation possesses an industrialized economy, fueled by raw resources it had extracted from its former overseas colonies. They possess a robust middle class, with a large degree of disposable income and liberal social protocols, especially among its youth. Education is widespread, though during the Hundred Year War, its primary purpose was indoctrination. During the Hundred Year War, the Fire Lord expanded the territory of the Fire Nation to access the resources of the Earth Kingdom, populating oversea colonies with forcibly relocated peasants. Over time, these grievances were forgotten, and the colonies themselves became prosperous, so much so that the citizens resisted efforts to return them to the Fire Nation. Still, mainland citizens looked down upon those from the colonies, regarding them to be uncultured."}]
