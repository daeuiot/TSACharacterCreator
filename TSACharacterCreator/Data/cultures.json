[{"key":"CULEK","name":"Earth Kingdom","description":"This vast realm spans an entire continent as well as several subsidiary  islands;it  is  the  largest  and  most  populated sovereignty  in  the  world  and  encompasses  much  of  the easternhemisphere.   Like   the   Fire   Nation,   the   Earth Kingdom is ruled by a central monarchy. The people of the Earth  Kingdom  are  proud  and  strong  and  adhere  to  a philosophy  of  peaceful  coexistence  and  cooperation  with the  other  nations  of  the  world.  Earthbenders  use  their abilities for defense and industry and fiercely defended their cities against Fire Nation attacks during the Hundred Year War. It also has a large economy based on agriculture and limited  industry,  though  it  is  not  as  economically  powerful as   the Fire   Nation,   which   benefits   from   advanced technology.The  Earth  Kingdom  is  characterized  by  significant  ethnic and cultural diversity, a consequence of the country\u0027s vast territorial expanse. Thus, it suffers from high levels of local autonomy   and   ethnic   conflict,   both   of   which   began accelerating as the central government grew weak. Despite this division, the people\u0027s recognition of the Earth Kingdom as  a  single  political  entity  is  largely  strengthened  through the communal belief in a shared history and identity."}]
